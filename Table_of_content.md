## Setup
To not show this message, or if there's actually something wrong (which there probably is), tell me how to solve the problem or where to find this 'ShaDa' file and correct it. Sorry if this is obvious but it's very invasive! <br>

I'm not sure where to look the error code up, so I made sure to include it in the title of this issue in case others have this problem too.

## Branch
Would it be possible (or desirable) for NeoVim to automatically fix or delete the file? Failing that, could the error at least prompt the user to delete it themselves?

**Command for configuration** <br>

`rm -rf /home/zh/.local/share/nvim/shada/*`

Should this be closed? While it's easy to fix, it's too common of an occurrence...
